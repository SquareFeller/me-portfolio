        <p>
          My name is <strong>Isai Rincon</strong>! I earned my B.S. in Computer
          Science: Computer Game Design from the University of California, Santa
          Cruz in 2025! I grew up loving video games so much that I eventually
          wanted to develop some of my own! Fresh out of college, I'm aiming to
          really jumpstart my career as a game developer and would love to
          <strong><a href="#contact">chat with you!!</a></strong> In the
          meantime, I'm continuing to reach out and hone my skills in web dev
          and game dev (and playing video games, of course). <br />

                <h1>Development</h1>
                <p>
                  <i>Markus's Miasma</i> began development in my senior year at
                  UCSC. Over the course of 6 months, we, as a team of 8,
                  ideated, designed, playtested, iterated, and ultimately
                  published our game on Steam. <br />
                  We developed our game in <strong>Unity</strong> as our group
                  was the most comfortable with that engine. We also made use of
                  the scrum framework with <strong>taiga.io</strong> serving as
                  our project management tool.
                </p>
                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>
                  At the start of development, I assisted with general ideation,
                  moodboards, story concept, and basic player movement.
                  Eventually, as the weeks went on, I moved into
                  <strong>gameplay programming</strong> and
                  <strong>SFX design and implementation</strong>. I found music
                  from opengameart.org and sounds from freesound (and even got
                  to record some of my own!), and then had to implement them,
                  keeping a close eye (ear?) on timing and volume mixing. <br />
                  In addition to audio design, I was often one of the main
                  <strong>QA testers</strong>, frequently looking for and
                  squashing bugs and creating playable builds of our game for
                  every significant milestone!

                  <i>Wizard Wobble</i> was developed in 5 weeks in my first game
                  design course at UCSC -
                  <i>CMPM 80K: Foundations of Video Game Design</i>. We were
                  given the theme "gauntlet" which we interpreted as a trial of
                  sorts. As a team of 3, we used the
                  <strong>Construct 3 Game Engine</strong> and its limited
                  number of events. We had to come up with the basic idea of the
                  game in the first week and then spent the next four designing,
                  playtesting, and iterating.
                </p>
                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>
                  I was one of two <strong>programmers</strong> on the team. I
                  spent a lot of time working on
                  <strong>character feel and movement</strong>, as well as
                  <strong>enemy design</strong> (special shout-out to the laser
                  octopus and the persistent orb of doom). I was also a
                  note-taker during playtesting, gathering feedback from players
                  to inform our next round of iteration.

                  <i>Killer Deal</i> was developed in a week as a submission for
                  the
                  <a href="https://itch.io/jam/shroomjam-2025" target="_blank"

                  It was developed after graduation and we were the same
                  3-person team that made <i>Wizard Wobble</i>! Our engine of
                  choice this time was <strong>Godot</strong> as we set out to
                  make a game that fit the theme of "Retro TV". This game was
                  also an opportunity for us to experiment with
                  <strong>mixed media</strong> -- combining pixel art with
                  live-action video. For our efforts, we were ranked
                  <strong>#8 in Audio</strong> and
                  <strong>#1 in Theme Use</strong>.
                </p>
                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p>
                  I was one of two <strong>programmers</strong> on the team.
                  Since the game was largely point-and-click, I chose to devote
                  most of my effort to gathering the roughly 40 video files that
                  would be in our game. I was so enthused by it because having
                  some live-action element in a game I contributed to has been a
                  desire of mine ever since I devoured <i>Alan Wake 2</i>. I
                  became very familiar with
                  <strong>video compression and conversion</strong> as a result.
                  I implemented the videos into the game along with the music
                  and SFX, so I was back at it being an
                  <strong>audio designer</strong> and all-around bug-squasher.
