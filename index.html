        <h1>Welcome! 👋🏽</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Isai Rincon</strong>! I earned my B.S. in Computer
          Science: Computer Game Design from the University of California, Santa
          Cruz in 2025! I grew up loving video games so much that I eventually
          wanted to develop some of my own! Fresh out of college, I'm aiming to
          really jumpstart my career as a game developer and would love to
          <strong><a href="/">chat with you!!</a></strong> In the meantime, I'm
          continuing to reach out and hone my skills in web dev and game dev
          (and playing video games, of course). <br />

    <!--TODO: Organize the next section for your projects below your brief welcome (figure out what you want to show and how much information you want to share (which will also need to be organized and formatted)) Maybe use dashed lines to indicate that we're in a new section, like: https://marighoul.com/about
        TODO: Figure out how to make your nav links actually work and what you might actually want them to say (e.g. should About even be there? should it be called About Me? should it lead to a separate page altogether where I can dive deep into my history with games, etc? )

        TODO: For the projects, we can take a page out of Kaylee's and Nat's websites and have the user click on the project screenshot or something to expand it (maybe overlay a small container over it with more details and info and all that jazz)). So under the image for each game, add a quick description (either from Steam or itch) or come up with one surrounding development and your role. And then underneath that description, have a button or something with like a "Dive Deeper!" CTA that then brings up the more detailed info of the development, engine, team size, role, etc. 

        TODO: Keep messing around with more font sizes and alignments and stuff to account for different display sizes!!
